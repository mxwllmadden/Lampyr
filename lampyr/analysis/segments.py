    Extract event timestamps from a segment, aligned to a specified event order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : MultiSessionDataset
        Dataset containing session and segment data with event records.
    segment : SegmentReference
        Reference identifying the segment from which to extract events.
    events : Iterable[str]
        Ordered list of event names to extract. If an event appears multiple
        times in this list, multiple occurrences of that event will be filled
        in order of appearance in the segment.

    Returns
    -------
    evtimes : np.ndarray
        1D array of event times aligned to `events`. Entries are NaN when the
        corresponding event occurrence is not found in the segment.

    ----------
    data : MultiSessionDataset
        Dataset containing session and segment data with event records.
    segments : List[SegmentReference]
        List of segment references from which to extract events.
    events : List[str]

    -------
    event_times : np.ndarray
        2D array of shape (n_segments, n_events) containing event times.
